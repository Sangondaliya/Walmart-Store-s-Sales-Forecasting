# Walmart-Store-s-Sales-Forecasting

The objective is predicting store sales using historical markdown data.

You are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number of departments, and you are tasked with predicting the department-wide sales for each store.

### Business Impact
Understand the significance of accurate sales forecasting. It influences inventory levels, staffing, marketing strategies, and financial planning. Overestimating or underestimating sales can lead to stockouts, excess inventory, and missed revenue opportunities.

### Seasonality and Trends
Analyze historical data to identify patterns, seasonality, and trends in sales. Understanding these patterns helps in making informed forecasts, especially for peak seasons and promotional periods.

### External Factors
Consider external variables that can impact sales, such as holidays, special events, weather conditions, and economic indicators. Incorporating these factors can enhance forecast accuracy.

### Store Variability
Different Walmart stores can have unique characteristics, demographics, and local influences. Account for store-specific factors that might affect sales, such as location type (urban vs. rural), store size, and customer preferences.
